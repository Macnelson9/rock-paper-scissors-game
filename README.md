# rock-paper-scissors-game
In this project, I create a rock, paper, scissors game. The computer will also choose a random option, and the results will be displayed. you can win, lose or tie. Scores are tracked at the bottom. I will use HTML for structure, CSS for a modern look, and JavaScript to generate the computer's choice and compare the results. This game is an interactive way to test your luck and strategy against a computer opponent.
